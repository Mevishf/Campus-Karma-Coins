# Campus Karma Coins 💰🏫

A decentralized rewards system for college campuses, built using blockchain technology. Campus Karma Coins (CKC) allows students to earn crypto-based tokens for good deeds, participation, and contributions to the campus ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Campus Karma Coins is a blockchain-based application that mints and distributes ERC-20 tokens to students as recognition for positive actions — like volunteering, helping peers, participating in events, and more.
These tokens are tracked on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness in reward distribution.
